Map/Reduce scripts and job control files.
It's recommended that all the mapper and reducer functions to be in one script
 and run as "script.py map", "script.py reduce" and etc. The reason for this is
 because all the scripts need to be shipped to individual nodes through 
--cacheFile arguments. If you have your scripts all over places, it can 
easily make your job flow files unmanageable. 
TODO(yunfang): For highly reusable modules, create a ka_lib directory. It will
be jarred and sync'ed to s3 to be used along with the map/reduce scripts. 
The json files are JobFlow files that can be run with the elastic-mapreduce 
cli like "elastic-mapreduce --create --json <jsonfile>"
