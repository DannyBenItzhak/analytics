Scripts and tools for using http://www.webpagetest.org/

www.webpagetest.org is a tool for measuring the performance of web
pages.  In our case, we use a tool that downloads and renders KA web
pages from various locations and using various browsers, and records
information like time to first byte, time until page is rendered, time
until onload handlers fire, etc.

We downloaded the files in this directory from:
   http://webpagetest.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/batchtool/wpt_batch.py
   http://webpagetest.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/batchtool/wpt_batch_lib.py

The list of webpagetest locations comes from:
   http://www.webpagetest.org/getLocations.php

The API key was given to us by pmeenan@webpagetest.org.
