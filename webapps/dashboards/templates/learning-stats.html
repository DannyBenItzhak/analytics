        <div class="row">
            <div class="span4">
                <h3>Why?</h3>
                <p>
                    We're trying out various things this summer &mdash; custom
                    stacks, inserting videos in stacks, different card selection
                    algorithms, etc. Are these efforts meaningful, and do they
                    improve student learning?
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="span8">
                <h3>How?</h3>
                <p>
                    We'll attempt to measure the learning efficiency
                    &mdash; that is, how much your accuracy on exercises
                    increases over the number of cards you do or time taken.
                    For each group we're comparing (a <strong>segment</strong>),
                    we'll also look at student retention &mdash; the percent of
                    students that stick to a topic as the number of cards or
                    time increases. We can then take the product of the two to
                    get overall net learning.
                </p>

        <h2>Learning Efficiency <small>(Gain in accuracy)</small></h2>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="span4">
                <h3>How is data collected?</h3>
                <p>
                    For exercises done in topic mode, every problem has a 1/8
                    chance of being from a randomly selected exercise from
                    within that topic. Only these cards are used to assess
                    performance/accuracy. This helps keep performance
                    measurement independent of the segment that's being
                    observed. For example, a card selection algorithm that
                    starts off with hard problems but then gives easy problems
                    could lead one to falsely conclude that students are vastly
                    improving in accuracy.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="span8">
                <h3>What is "gain in accuracy"?</h3>
                <p>
                    We want to study the effect of our exercises on student
                    learning free from influence by students who already know
                    a topic well. Thus, we only look at <em>changes</em> in
                    accuracies for a particular student working on a particular
                    topic. We interpolate change in accuracy between every
                    consecutive pair of random cards.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, suppose for a given topic a student answers
                </p>

                <blockquote>
                    [<i class="icon-remove"></i>]
                    <i class="icon-remove"></i>
                    <i class="icon-remove"></i>
                    <i class="icon-ok"></i>
                    [<i class="icon-ok"></i>]
                    <i class="icon-ok"></i>
                    <i class="icon-ok"></i>
                    <i class="icon-ok"></i>
                    &hellip;
                </blockquote>

                <p>
                    where the first and fifth cards are randomly drawn
                    from that topic. All we know is that the student went from
                    0% to 100% correct from the first to the fifth card. We
                    evenly distribute this gain and say:
                </p>

                <blockquote>
                    <span class="label">card 1: +0.25 gain in accuracy</span>
                    <span class="label label-inverse">card 2: +0.25</span>
                    <span class="label">card 3: +0.25</span>
                    <span class="label label-inverse">card 4: +0.25</span>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    We then average all the gains for each card number. The graph above is just the integral of this function.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="span4">
                <h3>What is an "incremental gain"?</h3>
                <p>
                    This is a single interpolated gain we output. For the
                    example above of the first and fifth cards being random
                    analytics cards, we'd output 4 incremental gains.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="span8">
                <h3>Why segment by number of stacks done and topic?</h3>
                <p>
                    A fast learner may blast through absolute values in
                    2 stacks, while one who finishes in 4 stacks might
                    have only started learning after 2 stacks. Our graph of
                    accumulated gains would mix these populations and may show
                    increasing gains in the first 2 stacks as well as after
                    that, due to, respectively, the fast and slow learner.
                <p>
                </p>
                    However, for just comparing across different segments, this
                    is probably too fine grained and it may be OK to mix slow
                    and fast learners when just comparing between curves.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="span4">
                <h3>These curves are not very smooth or increasing</h3>
                <p>
                    We're (Jace and David) investigating that. The data drop-off
                    is also pretty steep as the number of stacks increase. We're
                    going to be focusing on retention/engagement graphs next,
                    which will hopefully complement this.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="span8">
                <h3>What's next?</h3>
                <p>
                    Too much. See my <a href="https://trello.com/card/learning-curves-talk-to-jace/4f9f3469a81e7053712b88ad/72">Trello card</a>
                    and <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/khanacademy.org/document/d/1kYBq86n-FuJmq94Fjguy71AV8MIZs0t3KSalTIxDXPw/edit">Jace's notes</a>.
                    In particular, actually segmenting by users (experiments
                    they're in, coached or not, etc.), retention/engagement
                    graphs, bucketing by time taken, and world domination.
