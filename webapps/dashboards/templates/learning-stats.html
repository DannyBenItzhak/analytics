        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="span4">
                <h3>Why?</h3>
                <p>
                    We're trying out various things this summer &mdash; custom
                    stacks, inserting videos in stacks, different card selection
                    algorithms, etc. Are these efforts meaningful, and do they
                    improve student learning?
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="span8">
                <h3>How?</h3>
                <p>
                    We'll attempt to measure the learning efficiency
                    &mdash; that is, how much your accuracy on exercises
                    increases over the number of cards you do or time taken.
                    For each group we're comparing (a <strong>segment</strong>),
                    we'll also look at student retention &mdash; the percent of
                    students that stick to a topic as the number of cards or
                    time increases. We can then take the product of the two to
                    get overall net learning.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h2>Learning efficiency <small>(Gain in accuracy)</small></h2>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="span4">
                <h3>How is data collected?</h3>
                <p>
                    For exercises done in topic mode, every problem has a 1/8
                    chance of being from a randomly selected exercise from
                    within that topic. Only these cards are used to assess
                    performance/accuracy. This helps keep performance
                    measurement independent of the segment that's being
                    observed. For example, a card selection algorithm that
                    starts off with hard problems but then gives easy problems
                    could lead one to falsely conclude that students are vastly
                    improving in accuracy.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="span8">
                <h3>What is "gain in accuracy"?</h3>
                <p>
                    We want to study the effect of our exercises on student
                    learning free from influence by students who already know
                    a topic well. Thus, we only look at <em>changes</em> in
                    accuracies for a particular student working on a particular
                    topic. We interpolate change in accuracy between every
                    consecutive pair of random cards.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, suppose for a given topic a student answers
                </p>

                <blockquote>
                    [<i class="icon-remove"></i>]
                    <i class="icon-remove"></i>
                    <i class="icon-remove"></i>
                    <i class="icon-ok"></i>
                    [<i class="icon-ok"></i>]
                    <i class="icon-ok"></i>
                    <i class="icon-ok"></i>
                    <i class="icon-ok"></i>
                    &hellip;
                </blockquote>

                <p>
                    where the first and fifth cards are randomly drawn
                    from that topic. All we know is that the student went from
                    0% to 100% correct from the first to the fifth card. We
                    evenly distribute this gain and say:
                </p>

                <blockquote>
                    <span class="label">card 1: +0.25 gain in accuracy</span>
                    <span class="label label-inverse">card 2: +0.25</span>
                    <span class="label">card 3: +0.25</span>
                    <span class="label label-inverse">card 4: +0.25</span>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    We then average all the gains for each card number. The graph above is just the integral of this function.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="span4">
                <h3>What is an "incremental gain"?</h3>
                <p>
                    This is a single interpolated gain we output. For the
                    example above of the first and fifth cards being random
                    analytics cards, we'd output 4 incremental gains.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="span8">
                <h3>Why segment by number of stacks done and topic?</h3>
                <p>
                    A fast learner may blast through absolute values in
                    2 stacks, while one who finishes in 4 stacks might
                    have only started learning after 2 stacks. Our graph of
                    accumulated gains would mix these populations and may show
                    increasing gains in the first 2 stacks as well as after
                    that, due to, respectively, the fast and slow learner.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, for just comparing across different segments, this
                    is probably too fine grained and it may be OK to mix slow
                    and fast learners when just comparing between curves.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="span12">
                <h3>These curves are not very smooth or increasing</h3>
                <p>
                    We're (Jace and David) investigating that. The data drop-off
                    is also pretty steep as the number of stacks increase. We're
                    going to be focusing on retention/engagement graphs next,
                    which will hopefully complement this.
                </p>

        <h2>Other graphs</h2>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="span4">
                <h3>Percent correct</h3>
                <p>
                    At every card number, we simply graph the percent of
                    responses that were correct on their first attempt.
                    Currently, we don't use the random analytics cards here that
                    we use in accuracy gains. TODO(david): Use the random
                    analytics cards for the same reason we use it for accuracy
                    gains and to make comparisons with accuracy gain graphs more
                    meaningful.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="span8">
                <h3>User retention</h3>
                <p>
                    At every card number, we graph how many users have done that
                    card. We look at every problem attempt without filtering for
                    just the random analytics cards (as we do for accuracy
                    gains).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fine, you say, but what about students who finish a topic
                    because they became proficient in all skills? How can you
                    measure retention if the graph shows both students who gave
                    up and students who have completed a topic? Well, these
                    graphs are really designed to only meet one use case:
                    comparing alternatives within a single topic. Everything
                    else is off-label use. :)
