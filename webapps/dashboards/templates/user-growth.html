    This page provides an accounting-style analysis of how many
    <i>active</i> users we gained (or lost) over time.  
    <p>
    <b>What is an active user?</b>  An active user is a user who has 
    performed a qualifying action on the site in the last 28 days.
    <p>
    <b>What is a qualifying action?</b>  Currently, a qualifying action is
    any of the following:  starting a video, attempting a problem, or posting 
    a comment, question, or answer.  More activities may be added to this list 
    over time.
    <p>
    <b>Why 28 days?</b>  It approximates a month, but reduces extra noise 
    caused by the differing number of days in a month. 
    <p>
    <b>What does each line on the chart represent?</b>  
    <ul>
        <li>Joins - Registrations (by email or Facebook ID) of new users.</li>
        <li>Deactivations - Number of accounts that became inactive due to
            28 consecutive days of inactivity.
        </li>
        <li>Reactivation - Number of inactive accounts that became active again
            by performing a qualifying action.
        </li>
        <li>NET - The net gain (or loss) of active accounts in the period.  
            I.e., NET = Joins - Deactivations + Reactivations
        </li>
    </ul>
